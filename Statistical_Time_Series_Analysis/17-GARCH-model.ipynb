    "Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is a statistical model that is used to estimate the volatility of stock returns, currency exchange rates, and other time series data. It is particularly useful in financial applications where volatility tends to cluster, meaning high volatility events tend to be followed by high volatility, and low volatility follows low volatility."

This means that GARCH not only uses past squared errors (like ARCH) but also past forecast variances, which allows it to capture the persistence of volatility more effectively."

    "1. **Effectiveness of GARCH (1,1):** No higher-order GARCH models significantly outperform the GARCH (1,1) when it comes to modeling the variance of market returns. This means that adding more lagged terms (e.g., GARCH (2,1), GARCH (1,2), etc.) does not necessarily improve the model's ability to predict future volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Persistence of Volatility:** The conditional variance from two days ago is fully captured by the conditional variance of yesterday. This implies a strong level of volatility persistence, which is typical in financial time series.\n",
