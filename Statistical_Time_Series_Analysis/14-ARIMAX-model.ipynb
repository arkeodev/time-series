    "1. **Insignificant AR and MA Terms**  \n",
    "   - The large standard errors and high p-values suggest that neither AR(1) nor MA(1) terms are strongly identified in this data sample. It could be that the integrated random walk structure is overshadowing the AR/MA components, or there isn’t enough strong signal in 100 points to precisely pin down those parameters.\n",

    "2. **Non-Significant Exogenous Variable**  \n",
    "   - The exogenous predictor `x1` has a negative coefficient but also lacks statistical significance. In real-world scenarios, you might want more data or a more relevant exogenous series to see a stronger effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Residual Diagnostics**  \n",
    "   - High p-values in the Ljung-Box and Jarque-Bera tests suggest the residuals are not autocorrelated and look approximately normal, which is generally favorable for a time series model. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Potential Next Steps**  \n",
    "   - Try different orders (p, d, q) or add seasonal components if you suspect seasonal patterns.  \n",
    "   - Increase the dataset size or use a more strongly related exogenous variable if possible.  \n",
    "   - Compare the AIC/BIC to a simpler model (e.g., random walk with drift, ARIMA(1,1,0), etc.) to see if the exogenous variable meaningfully improves the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the model residuals look okay based on diagnostic tests, the AR(1), MA(1), and exogenous coefficients are not significant. This might mean the data (or the way it was generated) does not truly contain strong AR, MA, or exogenous relationships—or that the sample size is too small to detect them precisely."
