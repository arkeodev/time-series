    "- **Persistence of Shocks**:\n",
    "  - In AR models, a shock affects the values of the series indefinitely, with decreasing influence over time.\n",
    "  - In MA models, the impact of a shock is limited to the current value and a few subsequent values, depending on the order of the MA process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fitting to Data**:\n",
    "  - AR models are often used when the data shows a slowly decaying autocorrelation function (ACF).\n",
    "  - MA models are preferred when the ACF shows a sharp cut-off after a few lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - AR models can capture longer-lasting time series patterns or trends.\n",
    "  - MA models can be more effective for modeling time series that are mainly random with occasional shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**:\n",
    "  - **AR models uses PACF**: The current value is regressed on its previous values (lags). The PACF helps determine the order of an AR model by showing the partial correlation of a time series with its own lagged values, controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags. When the PACF shows a sharp cut-off after a certain lag (meaning that the partial autocorrelation is significant for the first few lags and then becomes insignificant), this suggests an AR process of the order corresponding to that last significant lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **MA models uses ACF**: The current value is a linear combination of past error terms (shocks). The ACF is used to identify the order of an MA model. For an MA process, the ACF will also show a sharp cut-off after the lag equal to the order of the MA process, indicating that there is a correlation with past error terms only up to a certain point, after which the error terms do not significantly affect current values. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - In summary, for AR models, the PACF tells us how many past values to include in the model, while for MA models, the ACF indicates how many past forecast errors to consider.\n"

    "- The coefficients in autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models should have absolute values less than one. This ensures that the effects of shocks or errors in the time series data do not become unbounded over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In an AR model, $ |\\phi_n| < 1 $ prevents past values from influencing the current value too strongly, avoiding a situation where the time series becomes explosive, meaning it would deviate further and further from the mean over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly, in an MA model, $ |\\theta_n| < 1 $ ensures that the impact of past shocks on the current value doesn't escalate indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In both cases, these conditions help to maintain the stationarity of the time series, meaning the series will have a consistent mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure over time. If these coefficients were equal to or greater than one, the series could show non-stationary behavior, where past data points or shocks have ever-increasing effects on future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both models are foundational in time series analysis and can be combined to form ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) models, which can capture more complex time dependencies. The choice between an AR and MA model typically depends on the data's characteristics and the specific patterns you aim to capture."
