    "1. **Covariance**: Covariance is a measure that indicates the extent to which two variables change in tandem. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, whereas a negative covariance suggests that one variable tends to increase when the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pearson Correlation**: Pearson correlation, also known as the Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1. A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect positive linear relationship between variables, -1 means there is a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables."

It tells you whether increasing values in one variable correspond with increasing values in the other (positive covariance), decreasing values in the other (negative covariance), or if there is no linear relationship (covariance near zero).\n",
