    "- The number of AR (autoregressive) terms (p)\n",

    "For the Likelihood Ratio Test (LLR test) to be valid, the models being compared should ideally be nested. This means that one model is a special case of the other when certain parameters are set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested models typically have the following relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are estimated on the same dataset.\n",
    "- The more complex model (with more parameters) reduces to the simpler model under certain parameter restrictions (usually setting some parameters to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the `ARIMA(5,1,1)` and `ARIMA(2,1,4)` models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ARIMA(5,1,1)` has 5 AR terms, 1 differencing term, and 1 MA term.\n",
    "- `ARIMA(2,1,4)` has 2 AR terms, 1 differencing term, and 4 MA terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of parameters for each (assuming both have a constant term) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `ARIMA(5,1,1)`: 5 (AR) + 1 (MA) + 1 (constant) = 7 parameters\n",
    "- For `ARIMA(2,1,4)`: 2 (AR) + 4 (MA) + 1 (constant) = 7 parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both models have the same number of parameters, they have the same degrees of freedom when it comes to comparing the estimated parameters. However, they are not nested models because `ARIMA(5,1,1)` cannot be reduced to `ARIMA(2,1,4)` or vice versa by just setting some parameters to zero. Each has different lag orders for the AR and MA components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a traditional LLR test may not be appropriate for comparing `ARIMA(5,1,1)` and `ARIMA(2,1,4)` because they are not nested. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you still wanted to compare models using some form of likelihood-based approach, you might look at other criteria like Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which are suitable for comparing non-nested models. They penalize the likelihood for the number of parameters, so the model with the lower AIC or BIC is considered better in terms of the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and complexity."
