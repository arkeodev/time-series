    "In ARIMAX, the ‘X’ refers to the exogenous variables, which are external factors or covariates that might influence the time series. These variables can include anything relevant that could impact the response variable you are trying to forecast but is not directly part of the series. For instance, if you were predicting demand for umbrellas, an exogenous variable might be rainfall. Unlike endogenous variables in ARIMA, exogenous variables are not predicted by the model but are included in the model to help improve the accuracy of predictions."

    "- A Boolean value (e.g., presence or absence of an event).\n",

    "2. It's important that for ARIMAX, you have data for the exogenous variables for every period you're trying to model.\n",
