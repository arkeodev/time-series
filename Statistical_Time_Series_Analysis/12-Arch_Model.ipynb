    "ARCH, which stands for Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, is a model for forecasting the variance of a time series that is conditional on past errors. It was introduced by Robert Engle in 1982, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. ARCH models are used particularly in financial time series analysis, where the goal is to model and predict future volatility based on past patterns of volatility. An ARCH model predicts the variance at time t as a function of the squares of the previous periods’ errors up to q lags:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_t^2 = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\epsilon_{t-1}^2 + \\alpha_2 \\epsilon_{t-2}^2 + ... + \\alpha_q \\epsilon_{t-q}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ \\sigma_t^2 $ is the conditional variance (a proxy for volatility), $ \\epsilon $ are the residuals from a mean equation, $ \\alpha_0 $ is a constant term, and $ \\alpha_1 $, ... ,$ \\alpha_q $ are the weights for the squared residuals. These models are particularly useful when the error terms have a tendency to cluster, indicating that high or low volatility in one period correlates with similar levels of volatility in subsequent periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike models that predict the actual values in a series, ARCH focuses on the variance of the series, forecasting periods of expected volatility — crucial for risk management and option pricing in financial markets."

    "- Autoregressive models can be developed for univariate time-series data that is stationary (AR), has a trend (ARIMA), and has a seasonal component (SARIMA). But, these Autoregressive models do not model is a change in the variance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The error terms in the stochastic processes generating the time series were homoscedastic, i.e. with constant variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some time series where the variance changes consistently over time. In the context of a time series in the financial domain, this would be called **increasing and decreasing volatility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- High volatility indicates that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction, which signifies a higher risk. Conversely, low volatility implies that a security's value does not fluctuate dramatically and tends to be more stable."

    "Heteroskedasticity occurs when the variance of errors or the spread of residuals within a dataset is not consistent across all levels of an independent variable. In simple terms, it means that the size of the error differs across values of an independent variable. \n",

    "In applying ARCH models to real-world data, there are several considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stationarity**: ARCH models should be applied to stationary series. Non-stationary data can be transformed using differencing or taking logarithms.\n",
    "- **Model Order**: The order (q) of an ARCH model should be determined based on the autocorrelation of squared residuals.\n",
    "- **Mean Equation**: Often, ARCH models are used in tandem with an ARMA model for the mean equation. This combined approach is known as ARMA-GARCH.\n",

    "Some of the real-time examples where ARCH model(s) applied: Stock prices, oil prices, bond prices, inflation rates, GDP, unemployment rates, etc."
