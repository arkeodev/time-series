    "- **Persistence of Shocks**:\n",
    "  - In AR models, a shock affects the values of the series indefinitely, with decreasing influence over time.\n",
    "  - In MA models, the impact of a shock is limited to the current value and a few subsequent values, depending on the order of the MA process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fitting to Data**:\n",
    "  - AR models are often used when the data shows a slowly decaying autocorrelation function (ACF).\n",
    "  - MA models are preferred when the ACF shows a sharp cut-off after a few lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - AR models can capture longer-lasting time series patterns or trends.\n",
    "  - MA models can be more effective for modeling time series that are mainly random with occasional shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**:\n",
    "  - In summary, for AR models, the PACF tells us how many past values to include in the model, while for MA models, the ACF indicates how many past forecast errors to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common and Complementary Properties**:\n",
    "  - In an AR model, $ |\\phi_n| < 1 $ prevents past values from influencing the current value too strongly, avoiding a situation where the time series becomes explosive, meaning it would deviate further and further from the mean over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Similarly, in an MA model, $ |\\theta_n| < 1 $ ensures that the impact of past shocks on the current value doesn't escalate indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In both cases, these conditions help to maintain the stationarity of the time series, meaning the series will have a consistent mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure over time. If these coefficients were equal to or greater than one, the series could show non-stationary behavior, where past data points or shocks have ever-increasing effects on future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combining AR and MA**:\n",
    "  - Both models are foundational in time series analysis and can be combined to form ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) models, which can capture more complex time dependencies. The choice between an AR and MA model typically depends on the data's characteristics and the specific patterns you aim to capture.\n"
