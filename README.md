# Time Series Analysis Repository

## Introduction

This repository focuses on Time Series Analysis, an essential aspect of data science that deals with sequential data points collected over time. My goal is to share insights and methodologies for analyzing time-dependent data, which is pivotal for forecasting, pattern recognition, and decision-making processes in various fields such as finance, meteorology, and more. Here, I start with basic time series analysis concepts and progressively cover advanced topics and models.

## What is Time Series Analysis?

Time Series Analysis involves statistical techniques to model and analyze time-ordered data points. By identifying the nature and patterns within time series data, one can forecast future points in the series. This repository will walk you through various models and their applications, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of this intricate field.
